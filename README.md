# Next.js Unexpected Behavior with Simple Page Component

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js where a seemingly harmless page component can lead to unexpected behavior. This might occur if there are other components or data fetching mechanisms in your application that conflict with the simple component.

## Problem

A simple Next.js page component that renders a heading and a paragraph of text may unexpectedly not render or may exhibit other unforeseen issues.  This problem is often difficult to debug due to the simplicity of the component itself.

## Solution

While the root cause of such unexpected behavior varies greatly, the solution often involves checking the following:

1. **Data Fetching Conflicts:** If the page uses `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths`, ensure there are no conflicts in how data is fetched and handled.
2. **Component Interactions:** If other components are used in conjunction with this page, review their interactions to determine if they are interfering.
3. **Contextual State:** Check if any global state or context providers are unintentionally affecting this component.
4. **Routing Issues:** Ensure the route is correct and there are no routing conflicts.

The solution file provides a possible improved version of the component, addressing the potential pitfalls.
